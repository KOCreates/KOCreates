I am an instructor at DMACC (Des Moines Area Community College) in Ankeny, Iowa.   I have taught math and computer science for 30+ years. I am passionate about helping students grow and succeed while also stretching your job skills and communication skills.  I have been an AP reader for the AP Computer Science A (Java) exam. I have taught introductory programming using the following languages: Pascal, FORTRAN, C++, Java, Scheme, Visual C#, SCRATCH and Python. My educational background includes a bachelor's degree from Mount Mercy University with a double major in Mathematics and History, a Masters of School Mathematics from Iowa State University. I am a homegrown Iowan, growing up on a farm in NE Iowa and I encourage you to consider staying in Iowa once your schooling is done to grow this great state – we need you. My hobbies include reading, needlework, tatting, stained glass art and gardening.
